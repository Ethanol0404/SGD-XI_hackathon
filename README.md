**SDG** XI Hackathon **2025** Topic: Healthy Cities **SDG** 3– Good Health & Well-Being Subtopic: Smart Healthcare Access Develop AI tools that identify underserved urban areas with poor access to clinics or hospitals. Prototype: Pollution-aware route planner

0  Name: UrbanCare
AI-Powered Pollution-Aware Smart Healthcare Access Platform
Integrating Air Quality, Traffic & Health for Healthier Cities
Background: Urban Health Crisis
1 The Growing Urban Health Problem
- Rapid urbanization is worsening air pollution & traffic congestion
- Long-term exposure to:
o	**PM2**.5, CO₂, NO₂  will incur Respiratory & cardiovascular diseases
- Heavy traffic causes:
o	Delayed emergency response
o	Higher stress & accident risks
- Existing open data is not integrated in real-time for health decisions
✅ Result: Vulnerable urban communities remain exposed.

2 Problem Statement
What Problems Are We Solving?
## People unknowingly travel through high-pollution routes
## Traffic congestion delays emergency access to hospitals
## Some communities are far from clinics & located in high-risk zones
## City planners lack real-time, integrated healthcare accessibility insights
## Lack of transparency on hospital capacity and ambulance availability reduces emergency care efficiency.
⚠ Current systems treat pollution, traffic, and healthcare as separate problems.
