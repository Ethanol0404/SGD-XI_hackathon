AI-Powered Pollution-Aware Smart Healthcare Access Platform  
Integrating Air Quality, Traffic & Health for Healthier Cities

Background: Urban Health Crisis

1 The Growing Urban Health Problem

-   Rapid urbanization is worsening air pollution & traffic congestion
-   Long-term exposure to:

-   PM2.5, CO₂, NO₂  will incur Respiratory & cardiovascular diseases

-   Heavy traffic causes:

-   Delayed emergency response
-   Higher stress & accident risks

-   Existing open data is not integrated in real-time for health decisions

✅ Result: Vulnerable urban communities remain exposed.

2 Problem Statement

What Problems Are We Solving?

1.  People unknowingly travel through high-pollution routes
2.  Traffic congestion delays emergency access to hospitals
3.  Some communities are far from clinics & located in high-risk zones
4.  City planners lack real-time, integrated healthcare accessibility insights
5.  Lack of transparency on hospital capacity and ambulance availability reduces emergency care efficiency.

⚠ Current systems treat pollution, traffic, and healthcare as separate problems.
